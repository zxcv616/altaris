The illiterate scribe
ð’ƒµ He who writes but cannot read

...and so it was revealed; the Codex Antegenesis, and the banished history of a dominion that was erased from reality

The work continues and more will be revealed upon further insight.

Much thanks and appreciation for the scholar .cutspace for his interpretations on these writings

ð’ƒµ He who sings but cannot speak
